        <p>Abstract</p>
        <p>TThe development of large language model (LLM)
            and visual language model(VLM) has driven rapid progress
            in embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) technology,
            opening up new avenues for robots to interact with the
            physical world and providing vast space for robots to perform
            more complex manipulation tasks. Traditional robot trajectory
            planning and control methods are sensitive to disturbances and
            have strict hardware requirements, making them difficult to
            apply in precise robot manipulation tasks. The diffusion policy
            does not rely on the robot dynamics model and can elegantly
            handle multimodal action distributions, itâ€™s suitable for high-
            dimensional action spaces, and exhibits impressive training
            stability, making it highly suitable for robot precise control
            task. However, the diffusion policy cannot interact with the
            physical world and is difficult to guarantee the generalization
            for different task scenarios. To address these issues, this article
            proposes an Embodied AI scheme based on the LLM and the
            diffusion policy. This solution firstly converts human natural
            language instructions into robot manipulation subtasks by
            LLM and then generates robot actions based on the diffusion
            policy. The combination of LLM and diffusion policy addresses
            the existing problems in robot manipulation tasks, this method
            not only inherits the advantages of efficient and stable diffusion
            models, but also realizes the interaction between robots and the
            physical world, and has strong generalization to different tasks.
            To validate our idea, we conducted simulation experiments on a
            7 dof Franka Emika Panda using Isaac Sim. The experimental
            results show that compared to previous embodied intelligence
            schemes, the scheme designed in this paper greatly improves
            the success rate and safety of task execution. In addition,
            this scheme has strong generalization ability for different task
            scenarios.</p>
